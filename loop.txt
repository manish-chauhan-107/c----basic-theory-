Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
They save time and reduce repetition.
C has three main loops: for, while, and do-while.

use of 'for' loop:
     for loop is used when number of iterations is known.

use of 'while' loop:
     while loop is used when iterations depend on a condition.
     It checks condition before running the body.

use of 'do while' loop:
     do-while loop runs the body at least once, then checks condition.
     It is different from while loop because body runs first.

break is used to exit a loop immediately.
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
Loops often use increment/decrement operators (++, --).
Loops help in printing series, searching arrays, and repeated tasks.
Infinite loop happens when condition never becomes false.
Nested loops means loop inside another loop.
Commonly used in patterns and matrices.
Loops improve code efficiency and reduce lines.
