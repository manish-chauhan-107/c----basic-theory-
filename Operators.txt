Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
They help in calculations, comparisons, decision making, and logical processing.
Arithmetic Operators perform math operations.
Symbols: + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), % (remainder)
Example: c = a + b;
Relational Operators compare two values.
Symbols: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=.
They return true (1) or false (0).
Example: a > b
Logical Operators are used in conditions.
Symbols: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).
Used mostly inside if statements.
Example: (a > 5 && b < 10)
Assignment Operators assign values to variables.
Symbols: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
Example: a += 5; means a = a + 5;
Increment and Decrement Operators increase or decrease the value by 1.
Symbols: ++ and --
++a (pre-increment), a++ (post-increment).
These are mostly used in loops like for.
Bitwise Operators work on bits.
Symbols: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Useful in low-level programming.
Conditional Operator (Ternary) is a short form of if-else.
Syntax: condition ? value1 : value2;
