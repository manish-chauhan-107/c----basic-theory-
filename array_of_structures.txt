An array of structures stores multiple structure variables of the same type
It is used when we want to store data of many objects (students, employees, etc.)
Each element of the array is a structure itself
Access structure members using array index + dot operator
Helps in handling large and organized data
Memory = size of structure × number of elements
Useful in record management systems
