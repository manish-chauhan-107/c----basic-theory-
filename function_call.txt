A function call is used to execute a user-defined function.
It transfers control from main() to the called function.
syntex:
function_name(arguments);

C supports two types of function calls:
Call by Value
Call by Reference

Call by Value:
Only a copy of data is sent.
Changes inside function do not affect original variable.

Call by Reference:
Address is sent using pointers.
Changes inside function affect original value.
