Pointer arithmetic means operations performed on pointers.
Pointers store memory addresses, not values.

Allowed pointer operations are:
Increment (p++)
Derement (p--)
Addition (p + n)
Subtraction (p - n)

Pointer arithmetic depends on the data type size.
If pointer is of type int, incrementing moves 4 bytes.
If pointer is of type char, incrementing moves 1 byte.
Pointer arithmetic is mostly used with arrays.
Array name itself behaves like a pointer.
Subtracting two pointers gives number of elements between them.
Adding two pointers is not allowed.
Pointer arithmetic makes memory access fast.
Used in strings, dynamic memory, and data structures.
