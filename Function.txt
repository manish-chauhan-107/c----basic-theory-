function :
         A function is a block of code that perform a specific task.it help in code reusability.
C - program are made up of many small functions. some are library function (pre define function)and some are user define functions:

library function :
function which are provided by 'C' standard libraries that performs a specific common task.these function already define by compiler.
example of pre define function :
printf(), scanf(), sqrt(), etc.

user define function :
function which are define or created by the programmer.it contain 3 main part that are 
--> function declaration : tells compiler about function name and return type.
--> definition : contains actual code of the function.
--> call : executes that function.

function call :
there are two method for calling a function 
--> call by value : 
      A method where a copy of the value is passed to the function.
Changes made inside the function do NOT affect the original variable
--> call by reference : 
      A method where address of variable is passed to the function.
Changes made inside the function affect the original variable
