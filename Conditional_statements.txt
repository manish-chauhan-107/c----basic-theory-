switch
if condition : 'if' statement runs a block of code only when the condition is true.
else-if condition :checks multiple conditions one by one.
else condition :run when all above condition are false .
switch statement : selects a block based on a variable’s value.
              case    :represents different choices.

Relational and logical operators are commonly used in conditions.
